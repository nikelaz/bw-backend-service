## Dependencies

This is a Node.js application (Next.js). The recommended Node.js version to run it is `20.11.1 LTS`.

## Installation

To install all dependencies just run:

```
npm install
```

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
|-|-|
| `build` | Builds the project with the TypeScript compiler |
| `start` | Starts the built JavaScript files from the application entry point (dist/index.js) |
| `dev` | Starts the application with ts-node from (src/index.ts) and watches for changes using Nodemon. This script is supposed to be used for development |

## Contributing

At this stage pull requests/contributions will not be accepted, as the project is being developed as part of a YouTube series and there is a strict plan by which the initial development will be done. If you wish to suggest changes during this stage you can leave a comment in one of the YouTube videos.

After the YouTube series is finished the repository will be open for contributions and I will update the guidelines.
